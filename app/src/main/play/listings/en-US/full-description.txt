WiFi properties which may be displayed by the widget are:
- <i>SSID</i>
- <i>IP Address</i>
- <i>Frequency</i>
- <i>Link Speed</i>
- <i>Gateway</i>
- <i>DNS</i>
- <i>DHCP</i>
- <i>Netmask</i>

You can configure which properties are to be displayed. Also, you can choose between a light/dark widget theme
independent of the set device theme, as well as determine the widget background opacity.
The app itself likewise supports both light and dark mode.

Feel free to hit me up with enhancement propositions, bug reports or whatever.

Built by yours truly, Janek Zangenberg.
